1. Overview:<br/>
- AgentOps is an advanced agent engineering platform that enables developers to build, test, visualize, and refine AI agent systems with unprecedented control and visibility. With an intuitive UI and powerful backend capabilities, AgentOps streamlines the process of creating reliable, dynamic agent graphs while providing comprehensive monitoring and optimization tools.

2. Key Features:
   - Interactive Playground Environment<br/>
    Create and manage multiple playgrounds for different agent projects<br/>
    Collaborative code editing with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense<br/>
    Built-in terminal for real-time code execution and feedback<br/>

    - Agent Graph visualization<br/>
    Automatically extract and visualize agent relationships from code<br/>
    Interactive node-based graph representation of agent structures<br/>
    Visual indicators for model types and communication flows<br/>
    
    - Intelligent Agent Refinement<br/>
    Automated agent graph improvement suggestions<br/>
    Advanced diff comparison between original and refined code<br/>
    Selective merging of recommended changes<br/>
    
    - Model Management<br/>
    Associate specific models with agent sheets<br/>
    Control which LLMs are available for different agent components<br/>
    Track model performance and resource utilization<br/>
    
    - Comprehensive Observation Tools<br/>
    Historical tracking of agent refinements and changes<br/>
    Detailed diff reports with visual highlighting<br/>
    Performance metrics and comparison across agent versions<br/>

**AgentOps Studios**

- Make studios with integrated EC2 configured containers to run your code.<br/>
- Visualize your agent graphs wihtout changing a single of code.
- Integrate with custom models from hugging face in a totally no-code environment.
- integrated loggers and profilers that save each of your runs/refines to facilitate state reversion and finegrained observations.

       Analyzes agent graphs to find God Tasks, breaks them into smaller modules, tries to optimize graphs using more modular structures. Dyanimcally shifts to better models for your tasks using hugging face's public endpoints for models.

**AgentOps Observe**

- Loggers record your runs, save your refine merges.<br/>
- Visualize changes made by our models in specific refines in proper diff reports.
- Make changes from any state to revert back to it.
- integrated loggers and profilers injected directly into your code help visualize time taken by different agents within your graph and helps you decode bottlenecks and see refined outputs.
