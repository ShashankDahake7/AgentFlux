    "## Step 4: Overview of AutoTrain Command\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Short Overview of What the Command Flags Do\n",
    "\n",
    "- `!autotrain`: Runs a shell command directly (commonly used in Jupyter or Colab notebooks).\n",
    "- `llm`: Specifies that you’re working on a language model task.\n",
    "- `--train`: Initiates the training process.\n",
    "- `--project-name`: Sets the name of the project (and output directory).\n",
    "- `--model abhishek/llama-2-7b-hf-small-shards`: Specifies the base model hosted on Hugging Face (here, \"llama-2-7b-hf-small-shards\" under the \"abhishek\" namespace).\n",
    "- `--data_path .`: Points to the directory containing your dataset. With `.` AutoTrain will look for your dataset (e.g. `train.csv`) in the current directory.\n",
    "- `--peft`: Enables Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using techniques like LoRA.\n",
    "- `--lora-r`, `--lora-alpha`, `--lora-dropout`: Configure LoRA parameters (e.g., rank, scaling factor, and dropout rate).\n",
    "- `--quantization int4`: Enables 4-bit quantization to reduce model size and speed up inference with minimal precision loss.\n",
    "- `--lr 2e-4`: Sets the learning rate for training to 0.0002.\n",
    "- `--batch-size 12`: Sets the training batch size to 12.\n",
    "- `--epochs 3`: Instructs AutoTrain to iterate over your dataset 3 times (3 training epochs).\n",
    "- `--mixed-precision bf16`: Uses BF16 mixed-precision training for improved performance and memory efficiency.\n",
    "- `--trainer reward`: Specifies that the Reward Trainer should be used (ideal for training reward models).\n",
    "- `--target-modules q_proj,v_proj`: Limits fine-tuning to specific target modules (in this case, the query and value projection layers).\n",
    "- `--push-to-hub`: Automatically uploads the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Needed Before Running\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Name:** After `--project-name`, replace `<project-name>` with the name you'd like to assign to your project.\n",
    "2. **Repository ID:** After `--repo_id`, replace `<username>/<repository>` with your Hugging Face username and the desired repository name. (The repository will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.)\n",
    "3. **Dataset Location:** Ensure that your dataset (e.g. `train.csv`) is in the root directory since `--data_path .` directs AutoTrain to look there.\n",
    "4. **LoRA Parameters:** Adjust the LoRA parameters if needed. Here, `--target-modules q_proj,v_proj` indicates which parts of the model to fine-tune.\n",
    "5. **Mixed Precision & Trainer:** Confirm you want to use BF16 mixed-precision training along with the Reward Trainer.\n",
    "6. **Authentication:** If required, include your Hugging Face credentials using `--username` and `--token`.\n",
